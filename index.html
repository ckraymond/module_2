      <h2 id="red">Sewickley</h2>
      <p>In 1853, the same year as the envelope-folding machine and the first World’s Fair, the “village” of Sewickley was established. Native Americans who inhabited the land had called the water that ran from the maple trees “seweekly,” meaning “sweet water.” Thus, Sewickley was born (and was almost called Sewickleyville!). To escape the smoggy air of downtown Pittsburgh, the iron and steel barons of the era built beautiful and historic farms, houses &amp; buildings, many of which are still standing today.

      <h2 id = "blue">Heinz Chapel</h2>
      <p>The Heinz Memorial Chapel began as a gift. Henry John Heinz, the founder of the H.J. Heinz Company, wanted to honor his mother, Anna Margaretta Heinz, with “a building” at the University. Mr. Heinz, who died in 1919, arranged to do that in his will. ... It is on the campus of a university.

      <h2 id = "green">Downtown</h2>
      <p>Pittsburgh boasts 90 neighborhoods with Downtown at its heart. Enter from the airport through the Fort Pitt Tunnel and see the skyline burst into view. It's why Pittsburgh is said to be the "only city with an entrance." With its lush green hillsides and beautiful rivers, the appropriately nicknamed "Golden Triangle," is a glittering gem. Home to a wealth of historic, cultural and entertainment sites, Downtown is booming with new residential buildings making it the city's fastest-growing neighborhood.
